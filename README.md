# Yelp-Search-Application

The task was to enable users to search Yelp businesses by term and location using Yelp Fusion API. The term can be business name or cuisine type. The location can be  geographic area to be used when searching for businesses or specific address. When searching by term it is required to specify the location, user can't search by term only. That is API's constraint. On the other hand, user can search by location only, in that case term doesn't have to be specified. 

Results are displayed in a list sorted by distance and rating. User can click on certain business in a list to find more information about it and to read its reviews.
